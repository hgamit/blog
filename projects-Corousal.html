Datasets were sponsored by <a href="https://www.farmfemmes.com/">Farm Femme(Soybean Commodity Data Sponsor)</a> and advised participant to freely use openly available dataset to optimize model predictions. Challenge was to predict 3 different Soybean Contract EOD prices for the month of November 2019.

            <p><strong>Multivariate Time Series LSTM Predictor:</strong> Learned and perfomed detailed analysis from scratch to produce best performing model. Used ideas from Stats, ML,Deep learnig and Commodity market to produce Multivariate Prediction Model. Our Student Team from St. Thomas GPS participated in two consecutive MinneAnalytics competitions (MinneMUDAC and FastCon 2019) and our work was one of the most competitive among the top performers leading most of the teams behind in predictions and technical Design Approach. We were ranked second based on our 15 days prediction for 3 different Soybean's future contract price.

			This competition was hosted by <a href="https://www.sas.com/en_us/events/sas-global-forum/program/awards-academic-programs.html">SAS</a> called SAS Global Forum 2020. The Sponsors wish to award outstanding student innovators with the opportunity to attend SAS Global Forum 2020 where they will have an opportunity to learn, network, and exchange ideas and experiences. This study utilizes publicly available data from the <a href="https://www.research.gov/common/webapi/awardapisearch-v1.htm">National Science Foundation (NSF) Web Application Programming Interface (API)</a>. We in process of producing context through BERT Language Model.
			<hr>
            <p>In this paper, various machine learning techniques are demonstrated to explore, analyze and recommend similar proposal abstracts to aid the NSF or Awardee with the Merit Review Process. These techniques extract textual context and group it with similar context. The goal of the analysis was to utilize the unsupervised learning algorithms to embed NSF funding proposal abstracts text into vector space. Once vectorized, the abstracts were grouped together using K-means clustering. These techniques together proved to be successful at grouping similar proposals together and could be used to find similar proposals to newly submitted NSF funding proposals.

			<p><strong><a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html">BERT Language Model:</a></strong> BERT builds upon recent work in pre-training contextual representations — including Semi-supervised Sequence Learning, Generative Pre-Training, ELMo, and ULMFit. However, unlike these previous models, BERT is the first deeply bidirectional, unsupervised language representation, pre-trained using only a plain text corpus.</p>
