            <p>This is real time data analysis project that involves visualizing and Forecasting Resource Utilization. The outcomes are to help administration to have business intelligence insights on product demand, fianances and resource usage based on time-driven utilization analysis.</p>
            <hr>
			<h5>Business Intelligence Grain Evaluation</h5>
			<p>Identify the granularity of each table and business process. Time-driven understanding of grain will help come to very important dimensions and measures. Various scenarious and Questios gets brainstormed to improve intelligent system.</p>
			<h5>AWS Cloud Infrastructure and Quicksight</h5>
			<p>Cloud infrastrcture built and developed to support different categories of company users. This includes Developers, DBAs, Visualization Team. Later several dashboards and stories have been designed and demonstrated to empower customer gains.</p>
			<h5>Hidden ML Insights</h5>			
            <p>ML Insights leverages AWS’s proven <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/features-ml/">machine learning (ML)</a> and natural language capabilities to help you gain deeper insights from your data. These powerful, out-of-the-box features make it easy for anyone to discover hidden trends and outliers, identify key business drivers, and perform powerful what-if analysis and forecasting with no technical expertise or ML experience needed.</p>
            
            <h5>Resource Utilization Forecasting and Anomaly Detection</h5>
            <p>Some of this work is in progress.Idea is to discover anomalies that exist in time series forecasting.</p>
